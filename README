#Skeltrack
## What is Skeltrack

Skeltrack is a Free and Open Source Software library for tracking
the human skeleton joints from depth images.

It is implemented with GLib and uses plain mathematics to detect
the human skeleton and although it does not use any database, it
was inspired by Andreas Baak's paper:
A Data-Driven Approach for Real-Time Full Body Pose Reconstruction
from a Depth Camera


## How to use it

Although it is device agnostic, a common way of using Skeltrack is
to use it together with a Kinect device, for which we recommend the
GFreenct library.

Checking out the examples/test-kinect example app is a good start in
order to learn how to use Skeltrack.
